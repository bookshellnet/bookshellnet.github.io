## Remedial Book Reading

For anyone reading this, in societal terms, the year 2020 is a great upending of what 21st century people would call normal life. 

Personally, it's giving me no excuse to not read as many books as I should. 
As part of reaching my reading goal of at least 30 books this year (last year was 24 and I reached it), I bought an ereader to help me read more, without straining my eyes as much.
